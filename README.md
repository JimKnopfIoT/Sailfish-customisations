# bash customization

I got some linux devices like Notebooks, RPi's and SailfishOS Smartphones.
It's anoying working remotly via ssh on this devices when powered by battery, not knowing the battery status.
So added this cool function to the bash command prompt.
Additionally i added different colors for the prompt for each device and user. 

Add this at the beginning of your .bashrc file or /etc/bashrc for global use.
I found the battery code on a pine64 forum but it had some issues. I fixed it for my best use case.
